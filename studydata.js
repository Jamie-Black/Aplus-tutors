The night before, I had reviewed all my notes and anticipated possible questions, but now, standing at the threshold of the hall, my heart pounded faster than ever. I dressed carefully in my school uniform, trying to calm my nerves, and my parents wished me good luck with warm smiles that gave me courage.\n\nUpon arriving at the hall, I saw students from different schools busily going over their notes. Some seemed confident, while others were as nervous as I was. The atmosphere was tense yet electrifying. As the competition began, I watched the other participants deliver their speeches, each with eloquence and passion. It was inspiring and made me even more determined to do my best.\n\nWhen my turn finally arrived, I walked to the podium, feeling the eyes of the judges and audience on me. I took a deep breath and remembered my preparation. Slowly, my nervousness melted away, replaced by confidence. I presented my arguments clearly, using facts and examples to support my points. I paused occasionally, making eye contact with the audience and responding to questions thoughtfully. Each moment felt like both an eternity and a fleeting second.\n\nAfter all participants had spoken, the judges deliberated, and the tension in the room was almost unbearable. Then, the announcement came: my school had won the competition. I felt a surge of joy and pride. My friends and teachers rushed to congratulate me, and I could not stop smiling. I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and gratitude for the support I had received from my teachers and family.\n\nThat day taught me the importance of preparation, perseverance, and self-belief. I realized that hard work, dedication, and the courage to face challenges can lead to success. It also reminded me of the value of teamwork, as my schoolmates had cheered and encouraged me throughout the process. The experience left an indelible mark on my memory, shaping me into a more confident and determined individual. Indeed, it remains one of the most memorable and proudest moments of my life, and I will carry its lessons with me forever."

It is a haven of peace and beauty, where I often go to relax, read, or simply enjoy nature. From the entrance, one is greeted by a pathway lined with flowering plants in vibrant colors—red, yellow, purple, and white. The flowers sway gently in the breeze, releasing a delicate fragrance that instantly calms the mind.\n\nAs I walk further into the garden, I notice a small pond at the center. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the blue sky above and the green trees surrounding it. Ducks swim gracefully on the pond, occasionally diving beneath the surface, creating ripples that shimmer under the sunlight. Near the pond, benches are strategically placed, offering visitors a perfect spot to sit and admire the beauty around them.\n\nTall trees with thick, leafy branches provide shade along the winding paths. Birds sing harmoniously from their nests, filling the air with melodious tunes. I often see squirrels darting up and down the trees, adding life and energy to the peaceful environment. The sound of leaves rustling in the wind and the distant hum of bees visiting flowers create a symphony that is both soothing and uplifting.\n\nThe garden is well-maintained, with neatly trimmed hedges and clean walkways. Seasonal flowers are planted in specific patterns, creating a tapestry of colors that change throughout the year. In the evenings, the soft golden light of the setting sun bathes the garden in warmth, making it even more enchanting. It is during these moments that I feel a deep sense of contentment and reflection.\n\nMy favourite place is not only beautiful but also has a special meaning for me. It is a place where I can think clearly, away from the noise and distractions of daily life. Whenever I feel stressed or overwhelmed, a visit to this garden restores my energy and inspires creativity. I often bring my notebook and pen to jot down ideas or write poetry, as the tranquil surroundings stimulate my imagination.\n\nIn conclusion, this garden is my sanctuary. Its vibrant flowers, serene pond, melodious birds, and shady trees make it a perfect escape from the pressures of life. Spending time there brings joy, peace, and inspiration, and it is a place I will always cherish. The garden teaches me to appreciate the beauty of nature and find calmness amidst life’s challenges."

      {
        "type": "text",
        "data": "<b>Model Answer:</b>\nSchool uniforms have been a longstanding tradition in many educational institutions. While some people argue that uniforms limit individuality, I strongly believe that school uniforms should be compulsory for all students due to the benefits they offer in promoting equality, discipline, and school identity.\n\nOne major advantage of school uniforms is that they create a sense of equality among students. In schools where students come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, wearing the same uniform minimizes visible differences in wealth and status. This reduces peer pressure related to fashion and expensive clothing, allowing students to focus on learning rather than competing over appearances. When students dress alike, the sense of belonging and unity is strengthened, and bullying based on clothing is reduced.\n\nAnother benefit of compulsory school uniforms is that they promote discipline. Wearing a uniform instills a sense of responsibility and professionalism, preparing students for future workplaces where dress codes may be required. Uniforms remind students that school is a place for learning, and dressing appropriately helps set a serious and focused tone for academic activities. Additionally, uniforms make it easier for teachers and school authorities to identify students and maintain security within the school environment.\n\nSchool uniforms also foster a sense of identity and pride in the institution. When students wear their school colors and badges, they develop a stronger connection to their school community. This encourages participation in school activities and reinforces values such as teamwork, loyalty, and respect. Students who feel part of a community are more likely to uphold school rules and contribute positively to the learning environment.\n\nOpponents of compulsory uniforms argue that they suppress creativity and self-expression. While it is true that students may not express themselves through clothing, schools can provide alternative avenues, such as art, music, or clubs, to encourage individuality. The benefits of equality, discipline, and school spirit outweigh the drawbacks, making uniforms an essential aspect of education.\n\nIn conclusion, school uniforms should be compulsory for all students because they promote equality, discipline, and a strong sense of school identity. Uniforms help reduce social pressure, encourage responsible behavior, and foster pride in the school community. While individual expression is important, it can be nurtured through other activities. Overall, compulsory school uniforms contribute to a conducive learning environment and prepare students for future societal expectations."

I have been a loyal customer of ABC Bank for several years and have always trusted your institution to provide reliable banking services. Unfortunately, my recent experiences have left me dissatisfied and frustrated.\n\nOn several occasions over the past month, I have visited the branch to carry out simple transactions, including cash deposits and account inquiries. On each visit, I have encountered long waiting times, often exceeding forty minutes, despite there being only a few customers present. The staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive, and at times I received incorrect information regarding my account transactions. One specific incident involved a delay in processing a fund transfer, which caused me to miss an urgent payment deadline and incurred additional charges.\n\nI believe that the quality of service provided by your branch does not meet the standards that ABC Bank promises to its customers. As a client, I value efficiency, accuracy, and courteous assistance, all of which were lacking during my recent visits. Such experiences can negatively affect customer satisfaction and may damage the reputation of your branch if not addressed promptly.\n\nI respectfully request that the branch takes the necessary measures to improve service delivery. This could include additional staff training, better queue management, and regular supervision to ensure that all staff adhere to the bank’s customer service standards. It would also be helpful to have clear procedures for handling urgent transactions to prevent delays in the future.\n\nI trust that you will treat this complaint seriously and take appropriate action to enhance the quality of service at your branch. I would appreciate receiving a response at your earliest convenience regarding the steps you plan to implement to address these issues. Your attention to this matter will go a long way in restoring my confidence in ABC Bank.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nOlaborede James"

A number of people have accepted the moralist idea on smoking while a good many people have remained indifferent to the moralist view and have continued to smoke. The sameargument has been applied to the consumption of alcohol. The African moralist, basing his judgement on the behaviour of a few alcoholics, tend to regard the habit of taking alcohol as a sign of wretchedness. The moralist holds the view that anybody who forms the habit of consuming alcohol will never do well in life. While this may be true in respect of a few people in the society, the fear of the moralist has not been justified. \nHowever, the economist is primarily interested in the habit of smoking and the consumption of alcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to smokers and drinkers and so generate supply of and demand for tobacco and alcohol.\nSome moral principles associated with religion tend to lead on to economic problems. \nFollowers of certain religions are expected not to consume pork, take alcohol or smoke tobacco. Devotees of some religious groups, on the other hand, can eat pork while others are expected to abstain from alcohol and smoking. \nStrict observance of these moral rules could cripple the breweries, the cigarette factories and some businesses; however, there seems to be a growing number of alcohol consumers and cigarette smokers-a development which should be of interest to the economist.\n<em>Adapted from Peter Scott's article in Sunday Times."

It can be concluded from the passage that morality, religion and economy are (a) somewhat interconnected (b) clearly interconnected (c) certainly different (d) certainly unrelated\n\n3. According to the passage, the moralist idea is that (a) the smoking of cigarettes is bad and unacceptable (b) it is typically African not to smoke cigarettes (c) people should accept a point of view only when they are convinced (d) smoking is not good but a little alcohol may be permitted\n\n4. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage? (a) total abstinence from drinking and smoking is a religious obligation (b)smoking and drinking may have positive effects on the economy (c) every one ignores the moralist view on drinking and smoking (d) people who drink or smoke surely die of cancer\n\n5.

Until then, they were broadly divided into those which ate him when they got the chance, those which he ate when he got the chance, and a third group which competed with him for food, or was otherwise a nuisance to him in the business of keeping alive.\nIn the primitive situation, man was, therefore, basically against nature but, as the battle was progressively won, conscience crept in; the awareness of responsibility, and a failure to meet it, produced feelings of guilt. \nThose who live in cities and need no longer do battle against nature are nowadays most actively for nature. At this time, something like a thousand kinds of animals (vertebrate animals) can be said to be in danger of extinction. A few of them have been reduced to this precarious position by extensive killing but the majority are disappearing only as fast as the particular kind of country they need for existence is itself disappearing and all the hands of man, as often as not by mistake. \nThere are three species of turtles whose future survival is menaced by the demand for turtle soup, which would hardly justify the extermination of a giant reptile whose family has existed for 200 million years.\nLeopards are in jeopardy because of the fashion for their skins. As they get rarer, the prices rise and, as leopard skin become more expensive, the demand increases. No species can long survive the price of N60,000 which a halfgrown baby leopard now carries on its skin. \nAnd crocodiles, the longest surviving reptiles, are now dwindling alarmingly as a result of the fashion in crocodile skin for ladies' handbags and men's shoes. The human population explosion spreads mankind across the land surfaces of the earth at an alarming rate. There will be twice as many of us before most of us are dead. Does this mean no room for wild animals? Of course not.\n<em>Adapted from Peter Scott's article in Sunday Times.</em>"

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage? (a) man kills animal only when he can afford to do so. (b) man eats all categories of animals (c) man cannot spare those animals that eat his kind (d) man poses the greatest threat to nature\n\n8. The basic causes of the elimination of certain animals from the earth include (a) a deliberate battle against nature and the quest for leopard skin (b) man's decision to live in cities and the development of large farm lands (c) man's penchant for meat and the sale of animals for meat and hides (d) extensive killing of animals and the fast disappearances of their favourable habitats\n\n9.

Atoms bond to achieve stability, usually following the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to have eight electrons in their valence shell (or two for hydrogen and helium) to achieve the stable configuration of the nearest noble gas. Bonding explains the structure, properties, and behavior of substances in chemistry."

Typically, a metal atom loses one or more electrons to form a positively charged cation, while a nonmetal gains those electrons to form a negatively charged anion. The resulting electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond.\n\nExample: Sodium chloride (NaCl). Sodium (Na) loses one electron to form Na⁺, while chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to form Cl⁻. The Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions attract each other, forming a crystalline lattice.\n\nProperties of Ionic Compounds:\n• High melting and boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces.\n• Usually soluble in water.\n• Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water (electrolytes).\n• Generally brittle and crystalline in solid form."

His children needed school fees, and the landlord had given him a final warning about the overdue rent.\n\nJust as he sat down, an elderly woman approached. She greeted him warmly and asked for a small quantity of rice, promising to pay at the end of the week. Musa looked at her tired eyes and hesitated. He barely had enough to feed his own family. Yet something in her voice reminded him of his late mother, who never turned anyone away.\n\nWith a sigh, he scooped the rice and handed it to her. \"Thank you, my son,\" she whispered.

Often regarded as the greatest dramatist in the English language, he wrote tragedies, comedies, and histories. Shakespeare drew heavily on classical sources, and in Antony and Cleopatra, he based much of the story on Plutarch’s Lives.\n\nShakespeare wrote Antony and Cleopatra around 1606–1607. The play was first performed by the King’s Men.\n\nHis works explore universal human themes—power, love, identity, fate—which make them ideal for exams like WAEC and JAMB because they test character, theme, and literary technique."

He announces that a young woman named Eva Smith has died by suicide (drinking disinfectant).
