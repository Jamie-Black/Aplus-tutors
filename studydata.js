The night before, I had reviewed all my notes and anticipated possible questions, but now, standing at the threshold of the hall, my heart pounded faster than ever. I dressed carefully in my school uniform, trying to calm my nerves, and my parents wished me good luck with warm smiles that gave me courage.\n\nUpon arriving at the hall, I saw students from different schools busily going over their notes. Some seemed confident, while others were as nervous as I was. The atmosphere was tense yet electrifying. As the competition began, I watched the other participants deliver their speeches, each with eloquence and passion. It was inspiring and made me even more determined to do my best.\n\nWhen my turn finally arrived, I walked to the podium, feeling the eyes of the judges and audience on me. I took a deep breath and remembered my preparation. Slowly, my nervousness melted away, replaced by confidence. I presented my arguments clearly, using facts and examples to support my points. I paused occasionally, making eye contact with the audience and responding to questions thoughtfully. Each moment felt like both an eternity and a fleeting second.\n\nAfter all participants had spoken, the judges deliberated, and the tension in the room was almost unbearable. Then, the announcement came: my school had won the competition. I felt a surge of joy and pride. My friends and teachers rushed to congratulate me, and I could not stop smiling. I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and gratitude for the support I had received from my teachers and family.\n\nThat day taught me the importance of preparation, perseverance, and self-belief. I realized that hard work, dedication, and the courage to face challenges can lead to success. It also reminded me of the value of teamwork, as my schoolmates had cheered and encouraged me throughout the process. The experience left an indelible mark on my memory, shaping me into a more confident and determined individual. Indeed, it remains one of the most memorable and proudest moments of my life, and I will carry its lessons with me forever."

It is a haven of peace and beauty, where I often go to relax, read, or simply enjoy nature. From the entrance, one is greeted by a pathway lined with flowering plants in vibrant colors—red, yellow, purple, and white. The flowers sway gently in the breeze, releasing a delicate fragrance that instantly calms the mind.\n\nAs I walk further into the garden, I notice a small pond at the center. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the blue sky above and the green trees surrounding it. Ducks swim gracefully on the pond, occasionally diving beneath the surface, creating ripples that shimmer under the sunlight. Near the pond, benches are strategically placed, offering visitors a perfect spot to sit and admire the beauty around them.\n\nTall trees with thick, leafy branches provide shade along the winding paths. Birds sing harmoniously from their nests, filling the air with melodious tunes. I often see squirrels darting up and down the trees, adding life and energy to the peaceful environment. The sound of leaves rustling in the wind and the distant hum of bees visiting flowers create a symphony that is both soothing and uplifting.\n\nThe garden is well-maintained, with neatly trimmed hedges and clean walkways. Seasonal flowers are planted in specific patterns, creating a tapestry of colors that change throughout the year. In the evenings, the soft golden light of the setting sun bathes the garden in warmth, making it even more enchanting. It is during these moments that I feel a deep sense of contentment and reflection.\n\nMy favourite place is not only beautiful but also has a special meaning for me. It is a place where I can think clearly, away from the noise and distractions of daily life. Whenever I feel stressed or overwhelmed, a visit to this garden restores my energy and inspires creativity. I often bring my notebook and pen to jot down ideas or write poetry, as the tranquil surroundings stimulate my imagination.\n\nIn conclusion, this garden is my sanctuary. Its vibrant flowers, serene pond, melodious birds, and shady trees make it a perfect escape from the pressures of life. Spending time there brings joy, peace, and inspiration, and it is a place I will always cherish. The garden teaches me to appreciate the beauty of nature and find calmness amidst life’s challenges."

      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "data": "<b>Model Answer:</b>\nSchool uniforms have been a longstanding tradition in many educational institutions. While some people argue that uniforms limit individuality, I strongly believe that school uniforms should be compulsory for all students due to the benefits they offer in promoting equality, discipline, and school identity.\n\nOne major advantage of school uniforms is that they create a sense of equality among students. In schools where students come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, wearing the same uniform minimizes visible differences in wealth and status. This reduces peer pressure related to fashion and expensive clothing, allowing students to focus on learning rather than competing over appearances. When students dress alike, the sense of belonging and unity is strengthened, and bullying based on clothing is reduced.\n\nAnother benefit of compulsory school uniforms is that they promote discipline. Wearing a uniform instills a sense of responsibility and professionalism, preparing students for future workplaces where dress codes may be required. Uniforms remind students that school is a place for learning, and dressing appropriately helps set a serious and focused tone for academic activities. Additionally, uniforms make it easier for teachers and school authorities to identify students and maintain security within the school environment.\n\nSchool uniforms also foster a sense of identity and pride in the institution. When students wear their school colors and badges, they develop a stronger connection to their school community. This encourages participation in school activities and reinforces values such as teamwork, loyalty, and respect. Students who feel part of a community are more likely to uphold school rules and contribute positively to the learning environment.\n\nOpponents of compulsory uniforms argue that they suppress creativity and self-expression. While it is true that students may not express themselves through clothing, schools can provide alternative avenues, such as art, music, or clubs, to encourage individuality. The benefits of equality, discipline, and school spirit outweigh the drawbacks, making uniforms an essential aspect of education.\n\nIn conclusion, school uniforms should be compulsory for all students because they promote equality, discipline, and a strong sense of school identity. Uniforms help reduce social pressure, encourage responsible behavior, and foster pride in the school community. While individual expression is important, it can be nurtured through other activities. Overall, compulsory school uniforms contribute to a conducive learning environment and prepare students for future societal expectations."

I have been a loyal customer of ABC Bank for several years and have always trusted your institution to provide reliable banking services. Unfortunately, my recent experiences have left me dissatisfied and frustrated.\n\nOn several occasions over the past month, I have visited the branch to carry out simple transactions, including cash deposits and account inquiries. On each visit, I have encountered long waiting times, often exceeding forty minutes, despite there being only a few customers present. The staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive, and at times I received incorrect information regarding my account transactions. One specific incident involved a delay in processing a fund transfer, which caused me to miss an urgent payment deadline and incurred additional charges.\n\nI believe that the quality of service provided by your branch does not meet the standards that ABC Bank promises to its customers. As a client, I value efficiency, accuracy, and courteous assistance, all of which were lacking during my recent visits. Such experiences can negatively affect customer satisfaction and may damage the reputation of your branch if not addressed promptly.\n\nI respectfully request that the branch takes the necessary measures to improve service delivery. This could include additional staff training, better queue management, and regular supervision to ensure that all staff adhere to the bank’s customer service standards. It would also be helpful to have clear procedures for handling urgent transactions to prevent delays in the future.\n\nI trust that you will treat this complaint seriously and take appropriate action to enhance the quality of service at your branch. I would appreciate receiving a response at your earliest convenience regarding the steps you plan to implement to address these issues. Your attention to this matter will go a long way in restoring my confidence in ABC Bank.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nOlaborede James"

Often regarded as the greatest dramatist in the English language, he wrote tragedies, comedies, and histories. Shakespeare drew heavily on classical sources, and in Antony and Cleopatra, he based much of the story on Plutarch’s Lives.\n\nShakespeare wrote Antony and Cleopatra around 1606–1607. The play was first performed by the King’s Men.\n\nHis works explore universal human themes—power, love, identity, fate—which make them ideal for exams like WAEC and JAMB because they test character, theme, and literary technique."

Arthur Birling, a wealthy factory owner, gives a complacent speech about progress, individual success, and the future, claiming there will be no war. \nThen Inspector Goole arrives unexpectedly. He announces that a young woman named Eva Smith has died by suicide (drinking disinfectant). He tells the Birlings that he is investigating her death and begins to question them, revealing that each family member played a role in Eva’s life and her suffering. \n\n- Arthur Birling admits Eva worked in his factory but was fired for leading a strike. 8  \n- Sheila Birling tearfully confesses that she had Eva dismissed from a shop because she was jealous; she did not realize the impact of her actions. 9  \n- Gerald Croft reveals a secret affair with Eva (who called herself “Daisy Renton”) and that he helped her briefly, but abandoned her. 10  \n- Sybil Birling (Sheila’s mother) tells how Eva came to a charity for help but was refused because Sybil judged her; she did not take responsibility for Eva’s condition. 11  \n- Eric Birling breaks down: he admits he had a relationship with Eva, got her pregnant, stole money from his father to help her, and then abandoned her. 12  \n\nThe Inspector’s final message is a moral one: he warns the family (and the audience) that “we are all responsible for each other.” He suggests that if people do not learn social responsibility, society will face “fire and blood and anguish.” 13  \n\nAfter he leaves, Gerald and the Birlings rejoice, believing Goole was a hoax: there is no Inspector Goole in the local police force, and no recent suicide matching Eva’s death. 14  \n\nHowever, shortly after, they receive a phone call: a young woman has died in the infirmary in a suspected suicide, and a real police inspector is on his way to question them.
