  author: "Olaborede James",
  date: "2025-10-25",
  content: "A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. Students with this mindset see challenges as opportunities to improve rather than as obstacles. Instead of saying 'I can’t do this,' they ask, 'How can I learn to do this?' Cultivating a growth mindset involves embracing feedback, learning from mistakes, and celebrating progress, not just results. Teachers and parents can encourage it by praising effort over talent. When you believe you can grow, you open the door to endless learning possibilities and personal development.",
