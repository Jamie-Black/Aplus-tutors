"question": "<i>Read the passage and choose the most appropriate option.</i><br><b>Passage:</b><br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. One of the most common forms of AI today is machine learning, where systems improve their performance as they are exposed to more data. AI is already deeply integrated into daily life, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation engines used by streaming services. However, the rise of AI also brings ethical concerns, including the potential for job displacement and the importance of data privacy. As AI continues to evolve, researchers are focusing on creating 'Explainable AI' to help humans understand how these complex systems reach their conclusions. Ultimately, AI has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, but its development must be managed responsibly.<br><br>What is the primary definition of Artificial Intelligence according to the passage?",
